## pyChess
Making chess with python îˆµ

The library I use to make the game is **pygame**.
You can install using **pip*** with the following command line:

```
pip install pygame
```

To download the project and eject the source you just need copy the next command lines and past into the terminal:

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/vggm/pyChess.git
cd pyChess/
python3 main.py
```
